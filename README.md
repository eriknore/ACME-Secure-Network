Building a secure network for ACME
====

Repository for a project in the course Building Networked Systems Security (BNSS), EP2520. Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm (KTH).

See project-description.pdf for details on the project and the final report for details on how we setup the secure network.

We made this project as a group of four persons. I did more or less everything on the PKI, IDS and Web server with Google Authenticator. I also did some work on the Secure File Transfer Android application and some work on the FreeRADIUS server, setting it up with the router and contributed with a few rules on the Firewall.

Note that this project involved setting up a network on virtual machines (running Ubuntu), meaning this network does no longer exist - i.e. all keys and related are completely useless!

There was also a possible extension of the project (xPKI):

"Use of an 'external' PKI (to be updated)

As per the project description, it will be a strong plus to have your system working also with an external PKI, i.e., not your 'home-grown' one. 

Please see

and towards integrating it in your system. Please note that you have the option to obtain either 'traditional' credentials (certificates) or anonymized shorter-term ones. It is up to you to decide which you need."
